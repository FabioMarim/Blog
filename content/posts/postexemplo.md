Hello guys, My name is **Fabio Oliveira Marim**, and I am a technology and music enthusiast. Currently, I am studying Analysis and Systems Development at the prestigious Senai University in Joinville, where I am dedicated to deepening my knowledge in this fascinating field.

>*In addition to my passion for technology, I am also married to a beatiful woman named **Barbara louise** and have the joy of being a father to a lovely daughter named **Maria Luiza.** My family is my rock and my greatest motivation to pursue my dreams and goals.*

As a software engineer, I find fulfillment in creating innovative solutions and contributing to the development of apps and systems that can make a difference in people’s lives. My profession is a true calling, and I am dedicated to constantly improving my skills and knowledge in this ever-evolving field.

In addition to my academic background, I am also passionate about music. I am a multi-instrumentalist, playing guitar,  keyboard, bass guitar, and singing. Music is my constant companion, and I always find inspiration in it. I enjoy exploring different genres and styles, and I believe that music has the power to connect us emotionally and enrich our lives in various ways.

When I am not immersed in technology or music, I enjoy having fun with games. I am a fan of tabletop RPGs, and I love playing Age of Empires, Dota, and even some older games that not many people play anymore. I have a special appreciation for memories of the past, like the time when there were testimonials on Orkut and Linkin Park was the band of the moment, with their songs “In the End” and “Numb” dominating our playlists and topping the music charts.

> In summary, I am a technology enthusiast, a passionate software engineer, a devoted Christian, a versatile musician, and a nostalgic gamer. I believe that life is an exciting journey, and I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow and learn. And music is the soundtrack that accompanies each chapter of this thrilling story.
